- Uses standard AirPlay protocol
- No custom iOS app needed

### üñ•Ô∏è Enhanced UI
- Shows both protocol endpoints
- Real-time connection status
- Protocol-specific indicators

## Testing Instructions

### Method 1: iOS Control Center (Standard)
1. **Launch app** on Fire TV
2. **Note the IP address** displayed (e.g., 192.168.1.21)
3. **On iPhone**: Swipe down from top-right to open Control Center
4. **Tap "Screen Mirroring"**
5. **Look for "AirFire"** in the device list
6. **Tap AirFire** to connect
7. **Verify** iPhone screen appears on Fire TV

### Method 2: Custom Protocol (Legacy)
1. Use the original iOS app with TCP connection to port 5000
2. App will show "üì± Custom TCP" connection

## Expected Behavior

### On Fire TV Screen:
```
üî• AirFire for Fire TV
Fire TV IP: 192.168.1.21
üì± Custom TCP: 192.168.1.21:5000
üçé AirPlay: 192.168.1.21:7000
üì± Custom app OR üçé iOS Control Center
```

### Status Updates:
- `üçé AirPlay server ready on port 7000`
- `üçé iOS device connected via AirPlay: [iPhone IP]`
- `üçé AirPlay video data: [bytes] bytes`

## Troubleshooting

### AirFire not appearing in iOS Control Center
1. **Check WiFi**: Ensure iPhone and Fire TV on same network
2. **Restart app**: Force close and relaunch Fire TV app
3. **Check ports**: Verify no other app using port 7000
4. **iOS version**: Requires iOS 10+ for AirPlay discovery

### Connection successful but no video
1. **Check status messages** on Fire TV screen
2. **Look for**: `üçé AirPlay video data: [bytes] bytes`
3. **Try different content**: Test with photos, videos, home screen

### Performance Issues
1. **WiFi strength**: Ensure strong WiFi signal
2. **Network traffic**: Avoid heavy downloads during streaming
3. **Fire TV resources**: Close other apps if needed

## Architecture Overview

```
iPhone (iOS Control Center)
         ‚Üì AirPlay Protocol
Fire TV App (Port 7000)
         ‚Üì Video Processing
     Display Surface
```

## Next Steps

1. **Build and install** enhanced Fire TV app
2. **Test AirPlay discovery** from iPhone Control Center
3. **Verify video streaming** works end-to-end
4. **Report results** for any additional optimizations needed

The iOS app is **no longer needed** - iOS devices can connect directly via Control Center using the standard AirPlay protocol.
